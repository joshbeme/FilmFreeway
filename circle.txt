The goal is to draw a circle using SVG, the JavaScript libraries already included in the circle.html file, and whatever accompanying code you create.

Create the code necessary to produce a circle according to the input values. You can see an example of it working in circle.mp4.

Please keep in mind we would like to see code with proper design and abstractions to whatever degree would be appropriate for a real production system.
